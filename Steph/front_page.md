# Crochet Art!

Hi, I'm Steph and I love making lots of things out of crochet! I discovered crochet about two years ago and it has quickly become an obsession. I get kinda bored repeating something I've already done, so custom projects are my specialty. Even if I've never done anything like it before, just ask! I love learning how to create new things. 

## Types of croceht projects I can do:

* My current specialty is hats of all shapes, sizes, and colors.
* Any other warm winter accessory: scarves, mittens, arm warmers, leg warmers, ...
* Blankets, baby blankets, pillows
* I've only done two so far, but I'd love to do more amigurumi (little crochet dolls!)
