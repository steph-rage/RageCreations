# Welcome!

My name is Bobbie. I am an artist. I have Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) - a degenerative eye disease. I was homeless for years as a traveling street musician and sidewalk painter. Now I am a college graduate and paint instructor. I love to design and create custom art pieces with the aspirations to spark hope and to inspire dreams, spread the beauty of art, and to also spread awareness about RP and other disabilities. I am overjoyed with every project that we do here. I offer free estimates and design consultations with me personally to assure quality custom creations.  No order is too big or too small. We are so glad you could visit us! I look forward to your next custom creation!!

## Rage Creations include:

* Paintings
* Mixed Media Designs	
* Sculptures
* Photo Alterations
* Latex Masks (Coming Soon!!)
* Props and Replicas (Coming Soon!!)
